Pagination with "A Song of Ice and Fire" theme.

"Westerosi" is the plural form of "Westerosus".

I'm trying a different approach to react/redux, I'm dispatching the actions in the container components, this is completely different from the "standard" architecture in my other repos and from what I do at work.  My action types are named "westerosi.whatever" because later on, I might do something with Essos, which would result in "essosi.whatever" type of action.

I'm also using React-Bootstrap components with Twitter Bootstrap 3.  I really like this novel technique, very efficient, you only pull in what you need, and it's ready for production now, unlike BootStrap 4 Alpha 6.

I'm taking a few days off from React to learn Angular 4, but when I come back to this repo, I will implement redux saga.
